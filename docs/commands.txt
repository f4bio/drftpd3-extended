SITE ADDUSER
USAGE: site adduser <user> <password> [<ident@ip#1> ... <ident@ip#5>]

Adds a user. You can have wild cards for users that have dynamic ips Examples: *@192.168.1.* , frank@192.168.*.* , bob@192.*.*.* (*@192.168.1.1[5-9] will allow only 192.168.1.15-19 to connect but no one else)

If a user is added by a groupadmin, that user will will inherit the groupadmin's group.

All default values for the user are read from file default.user in /glftpd/ftp-data/users. Comments inside describe what is what. Gadmins can be assigned their own default.<group> userfiles as templates to be used when they add a user, if one is not found, default.user will be used. default.groupname files will also be used for "site gadduser".

ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword

This would add the user 'Archimede' with the password 'mypassword'.

ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword *@127.0.0.1

This would do the same as above + add the ip '*@127.0.0.1' at the same time.

SITE CHANGE

USAGE: site chgrp <user> <group>

site chgrp <user> siteop
user gets siteop flag

site chgrp <user> nuke
user gets access to nuek command

site chgrp <user> gadmin

site chgrp <user> deleted
deletes the specified user, same as "site deluser <user>"
