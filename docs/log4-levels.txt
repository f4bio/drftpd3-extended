Log Level
Defines the minimum set of levels recognized by the system, that is OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFODEBUG and ALL.

This is the available log settings in conf/log4j-default.properties. Just change "log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, A1" to one of the following settings.

ALL
The ALL has the lowest possible rank and is intended to turn on all logging.

OFF
The OFF has the highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.

INFO
The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.

DEBUG
The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.

WARN
The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.

ERROR
The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.

FATAL
The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
