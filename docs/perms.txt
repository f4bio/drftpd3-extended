ex. The following denys users the ability to make a directory in the root directory.
upload
upload /* !*

This line enables them to make directories in any other directories.

upload /*/* *

This can be repeated for other commands..

makedir
makedir directive tells MKD which dirs users can create directories in.

So to disallow creating of directories in root directory, just add makedir / !*.

Or don't add a permission that includes /, the default permission is to not allow creation of directories. /*/* would allow creating directories anywhere, but it needs at least two / in the name, so creating in / is not allowed but creating in /incoming/ is allowed.
