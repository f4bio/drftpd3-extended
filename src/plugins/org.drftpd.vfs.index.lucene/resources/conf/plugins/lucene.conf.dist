# Iterating over all the returned hits of the search is very expensive.
# This parameter limits the number of hits a search can return.
# The bigger this number is the more cpu/io/memory Lucene will use.
# Default (100) seems reasonable enough, change it on your own risk.
# A value of 0 will return all matches in the index, *NOT RECOMMENDED*
#
# More info: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed
max_hits=100

# *ADVANCED SETTING* The larger this setting is the least Lucene will try to flush your index
# due to the amount of buffered documents. Flushing is time consuming due to IO operations.
# As DrFTPd adds very small Documents to the index, this objects shouldn't use too much memory,
# so keeping some buffered documents is fine, although it's not good to keep many.
# If you are not sure on what to put here, keep the default.
# If you are experiencing too much IO due to this operation, you may want to increase this setting,
# but beware that increasing it will also increase memory usage.

maxdocs_buffer=120

# This setting works together with maxdocs_buffer but instead of flushing after specified amount
# of documents it will buffer up to specified amount of RAM before flushing.
# Keep in mind that it will flush "either or" (whichever comes first).
# Default (16MB) is high enough that maxdocs_buffer should kick in before this one.
# If you are not sure on what to put here, keep the default.

# Optimizing is good, but it is also expensive.
# When you optimize you merge your index making later operations faster.
# Highly updated sites should keep this number reasonable high, otherwise
# optimization will take a long time.
# Either you choose for optimizing often (resulting super fast search/indexing) but
# in the other hand you will use lots of resources while optimizing OR you live with
# slower searches and indexing and do not use so many resources often.
# 
# Default: 15 minutes (good for medium usage/updated sites)
# 30 minutes should be good enough for highly updated sites (maybe even higher).
# This value represents an amount in minutes.
optimize_interval=15

# *ADVANCED SETTING* Use native file locking.
# Networked FileSystems usually doesn't deal very well if this, so disable it, if you are using one of them.

# Backup configuration
# Interval before creating a new backup of the index, in minutes.
# Do not set this too low, it's advisable to set this +60 minutes.
backup_interval=120

# Number of backups to be kept.
# DrFTPd will delete the older backups automagically in order to keep your backup smaller.
# Keeping, at least, two copies is always a good approach.
# Setting this value to 0 will disable backups
